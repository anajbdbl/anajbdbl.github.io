            <h3>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h3>
            <p>This is the first assignment for us to get used to the layout of the website. I simply created the repo
                and created a python file where I wrote my short script before git adding, commiting, and pushing.

            <h3>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis </h3>
            <p> I approached this assignment by first going through the elevator data collection and handling each task little by little.
                Fortunately I took BA476 before this class and that prepared me on knowing how to use Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab.
                Because of that experience I was able to tackle this assignment task by task to the best of my ability using Google Colab.

            <h3>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization Webpage </h3>
            <p> I approached this assignment by first reading through the requirements and discussing with my peers how they were going to approach the assignment. 
                I then began doing things step by step, using resources available to me when I was confused about anything.
                <br> The demo to my finished website is in the repo for the assignment and it is also here:

            <h3>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition </h3>
            <p> I approached thus assignment by using Google Colab since I have some problems with imports on my laptop. 
                I then proceeded to complete the assignment step-by-step while discussing with my peers. I tested a number of 
                SVD components.
