            <h3>Assignment 0: Dummy Assignment</h3>
            <p>This is the first assignment for us to get used to the layout of the website. I simply created the repo
                and created a python file where I wrote my short script before git adding, commiting, and pushing.

            <h3>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis </h3>
            <p> I approached this assignment by first going through the elevator data collection and handling each task little by little.
                Fortunately I took BA476 before this class and that prepared me on knowing how to use Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab.
                Because of that experience I was able to tackle this assignment task by task to the best of my ability using Google Colab.

            <h3>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization Webpage </h3>
            <p> I approached this assignment by first reading through the requirements and discussing with my peers how they were going to approach the assignment. 
                I then began doing things step by step, using resources available to me when I was confused about anything.
                <br> The demo to my finished website is in the repo for the assignment and it is also here:

            <h3>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition </h3>
            <p> I approached thus assignment by using Google Colab since I have some problems with imports on my laptop. 
                I then proceeded to complete the assignment step-by-step while discussing with my peers. I tested a number of 
                SVD components.

            <h3>Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage </h3>
            <p> In this assignment, I had a lot of problems since I did not have the necessary dependencies to complete the assignment.
                These dependencies took 10+ hours each to download so I was not able to hand in the assignment on time. However, I used the
                starter code and slowly went through the assignment from there.

            <h3>Assignment 5: K-Nearest Neighbors </h3>
            <p> I approached this assignment by first reading through Kaggle and then taking a look at the starter code. 
                I also decided to do the lab before I approached the assignment because I felt like it would give me a better idea of where to start.
                I then went through the assignment, changing the number of splits, distance metrics, and k to ensure that I would have a good model.

            <h3>Assignment 6: Linear Regression </h3>
            <p> In this assignment, I had all the dependencies downloaded from assignment 4 and could therefore complete it. 
                I started by using the starter code given to us and what we did in class/lab to help me through the assignment. 
                <br> The demo to my finished website is in the repo for the assignment and it is also here:

            <h3>Assignment 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear Regression </h3>
            <p> In this assignment, I used some of the code that I had built in assignment 6 to help me with this assignment. 
                I also made use of the starter code that was given to us and the lab that we had this week. 
                I had some problems, especially NoneType when I tried to run hypothesis and interval testing. I was able to fix it
                by keeping my N and S at 70 like it said on piazza.
